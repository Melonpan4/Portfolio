      üõ°Ô∏è <strong>Intern - IT Support Administrator</strong><br>
During my internship as an IT Support Administrator, I got to wear many hats‚Äîhandling support tickets, chatting with clients to understand their problems, helping out staff with everyday tech issues, and keeping things organized with Excel. I worked closely with senior IT team members to figure out and fix more complicated problems. This experience gave me a solid mix of technical skills, communication, and organization that I know will help me succeed in any tech role.

      üë• <strong>LUCKIN COFFEE - Barista</strong><br>
Working in a busy caf√© wasn‚Äôt just about making coffee, it taught me how important communication, teamwork, and staying calm under pressure really are. Whether I was handling complex orders and helping teammates during rush hours, I learned how to keep things running smoothly by staying organized and supporting others. These experiences helped me build soft skills that carry over into tech where working well with a team, communicating clearly, and managing tasks efficiently are just as important as the technical skills themselves.

      üîê <strong>Self-Learning Projects</strong><br>
      Currently trying to complete online courses like HTML/CSS, JS, Python & SQL.
      This is also my very first time coding my own portfolio website! Although it is not very well developed and simple, it is definitely something unique, new and fun experience for me to do.
